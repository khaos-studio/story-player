# Story Player Documentation Roadmap

This document outlines additional components of the Story Player that would benefit from detailed documentation to ensure thorough knowledge transfer.

## Current Documentation

- [README.md](README.md) - Overview, UI components, data structure, features, and implementation
- [timeline_logic.md](timeline_logic.md) - Detailed explanation of timeline positioning and sizing algorithms

## Recommended Additional Documentation

### 1. Element Rendering System
A detailed explanation of how different types of elements (dialogue, action, transitions) are processed and visually rendered in the UI:
- How element content is extracted from data
- How different element types are styled
- The rendering logic for dialogue, character names, and parentheticals
- How to add support for new element types

### 2. Theme Implementation
Technical documentation of the theme system:
- CSS variables for theming
- How system theme detection works
- The implementation of light/dark mode
- How theme preferences are saved/restored

### 3. Project Data Format Specification
A comprehensive specification of the expected JSON format for project files:
- Required vs. optional fields
- Data validation rules
- Best practices for structuring project data
- Handling of custom metadata

### 4. Playback Algorithm
Detailed explanation of the playback engine:
- Frame timing implementation
- State management during playback
- Edge case handling (end of segment/composition)
- Performance considerations

### 5. Event Finding Logic
Documentation on how the player determines which event is active at a given timestamp:
- Search algorithm for finding events
- Performance optimizations
- Handling edge cases (gaps between events, overlapping events)

### 6. Element Dictionary
Documentation of the element indexing and lookup system:
- How elements are indexed for quick access
- Memory management considerations
- Handling missing or invalid references

### 7. Keyboard Controls Implementation
Explanation of the keyboard input handling system:
- Event listeners and key mappings
- How keyboard shortcuts are processed
- Adding new keyboard shortcuts

### 8. Responsive Design Implementation
Documentation of how the Story Player adapts to different screen sizes:
- Panel resizing logic
- Mobile vs. desktop considerations
- Accessibility features

### 9. JSON Data Loading and Processing
Detailed explanation of how project data is loaded and processed:
- Fetching logic
- Parsing and validation
- Error handling
- Support for different data sources

### 10. Extension Points
Documentation of how the Story Player could be extended:
- Integration with other systems
- Plugin architecture possibilities
- API for controlling the player programmatically

## Implementation Priority

If implementing additional documentation, we recommend the following priority order:

1. Element Rendering System - Critical for understanding how content is displayed
2. Project Data Format Specification - Essential for creating compatible project files
3. Playback Algorithm - Important for understanding core functionality
4. Event Finding Logic - Central to the player's navigation capabilities
5. Element Dictionary - Foundational for performance and data management
6. Theme Implementation - Important for UI customization
7. Keyboard Controls Implementation - Enhances usability understanding
8. Responsive Design Implementation - Important for cross-device support
9. JSON Data Loading and Processing - Valuable for integration scenarios
10. Extension Points - Beneficial for future development
